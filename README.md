# dbexplorer - Web Based Database browser application for Windows.

Copyright (c) John Holdsworth 2008

This repo contains the source for a windows application currently built using
Visual Studio 2008 that contains an embedded Java Web server serving pages of
the "jsql" database browser application to a Browser object inside the app
itself. This can be used to deploy web applications to a windows desktop once
they have been developed using [jhttpd](https://github.com/johnno1962/jhttpd).
This allows you to release applications with a rich Web 2.0 interface to a
Windows desktop that do not require a server side install.
